The game mode consists of two phases - the Recruiting phase and the Combat phase.

In the Recruiting phase, you build an ever-evolving board of Minions in Bob's Tavern. As the match evolves, you'll be given coins to spend on upgrading and modifying your board.

The Combat phase begins when your time in the Tavern is over. During the combat, you'll be thrown against a random opponent and your minions will fight until a victor is decided.

Current development status: All cards and mechanics have been implemented. However, no heroes have been added yet.

Feel free to ask if you are interested in contributing towards improving the codebase!
